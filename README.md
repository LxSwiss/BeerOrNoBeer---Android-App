# BeerOrNoBeer

The app is a Drinking Game on the Google Play Store. It shows random beer brands from all over the world. One player starts by deciding wether the displayed beer brand exists or not. If the player is right he can continue playing or pass the Smartphone to the next person. But if a person guesses wrong he has to drink as many times as it says. The amount a person has to drink depends on how many times each person has guessed right before.
